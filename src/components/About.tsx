          Hi, I’m Vaibhav—a passionate software developer with a unique blend of
          cybersecurity expertise and hands-on development experience. I thrive
          on solving complex problems, automating tasks, and leveraging emerging
          technologies to build secure, scalable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey started during my undergraduate studies, where I developed
          projects using Selenium, web scraping, and bot-hosting to collect and
          analyze financial data. I then expanded my skill set during a software
          development internship, working with Java to build testing frameworks
          for mobile applications and gaining exposure to Django for web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Deloitte, as a Solution Advisor, I had the opportunity to drive
          automation initiatives that transformed client operations. I developed
          prototypes using Python, Django, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ, which evolved
          into the Oracle Cyberplex platform—saving thousands of hours by
          automating critical user-lifecycle activities and streamlining access
          control processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Arizona
          State University, where I’m working on microservices-based web
          applications featuring JWT authentication and AWS key management for
          secure data storage. I’m also exploring cutting-edge AI projects,
          focusing on automating and securing AI agent operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it’s building robust APIs, automating workflows, or
          integrating advanced security measures, I’m excited to use my diverse
          skills to drive impactful solutions.
